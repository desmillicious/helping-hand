#Helping Hand;
**A social intelligence app to assist those with problematic behaviours**

Helping Hand combines the wisdom of 
your trusted family and friends to
help you intervene when your behaviour
starts getting out of hand.

The app is designed for bipolar people,
but could also be helpful to those
with problematic behaviours of any kind,
or those who simply want to improve themselves.

It is intended to be a social self-improvement
tool, to help keep people out of trouble,
to prevent harm.

To get started simply nominate a
chosen group of your family and
friends, who will be invited to
create an account. Once they have
an account, they are able to log
about your behaviours (anonymously,
if they wish to) and can flag
worrisome behaviours with a select
degree of confidence.

For example, Bob met Alice for coffee,
Bob thought Alice was kind of manic
but he wasn't sure, so he sent Alice
a flag on helpinghand.io with 25% confidence.

Helping Hand will recommend a range
of interventions to remedy a slate
of problematic behaviours. It will 
help users by providing a unique 
feedback mechanism.

Helping Hand will also coach users
to build a relapse prevention strategy.
For example, should their health reach
a certain undesirable threshold - helping
hand will email the user with content the
user has pre-written to themselves, should
such an occasion arise.

The goal is to keep people out of harms way,
to interven early, to keep people out of 
hospital so that they can reach their full
potential living balanced, healthy lives.

#How it Works;

1. Nominate close friends and family
2. Complete a personality survey
3. Family and friends (your helping hands) create accounts
4. Your helping hands can flag when your behaviour is getting out of hand
5. Helping Hand will alert you to this, so you can modulate your behaviour before it all gets out of hand.
